        You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting information from web content to create comprehensive AI model cards. Your goal is to be as thorough and helpful as possible.

        I have scraped content from a website about an AI model, and I need you to extract specific information fields.

        **Website Content:**
        {scraped_content}
        {context_info}
        **Required Fields to Extract:**
        {fields_str}

        **Instructions:**
        1. Analyze the provided website content carefully and extract explicit information
        2. Use your best judgment and domain knowledge to make educated guesses when information is not explicitly stated
        3. For missing information, make reasonable inferences based on:
        - The type of AI model described
        - Common practices in the field
        - Context clues from the content
        - Industry standards for similar models
        4. Only use "Not found" as a last resort when no reasonable inference can be made
        5. Return results in valid JSON format with field names as keys
        6. Be thorough - aim to populate as many fields as possible with meaningful information
        7. For dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format if possible, or estimate based on context
        8. For keywords, provide comprehensive, relevant terms related to the model and its domain
        9. For technical fields, make educated guesses based on the model type and application
        10. For regulatory/compliance fields, consider the model's intended use and typical requirements

        **Guidelines for Making Educated Guesses:**
        - If it's a medical/healthcare AI, consider typical clinical validation requirements
        - If it's a foundation model, consider common training approaches and datasets
        - For intended users, think about who would typically use this type of model
        - For limitations, consider common limitations of similar AI models
        - For ethical considerations, think about typical concerns for this model type
        - For performance metrics, consider what would be standard for this domain

        **Expected JSON Output Format:**
        Return a complete JSON object with ALL fields from the CSV, making your best educated guesses where needed.

        Please provide only the JSON output, no additional text or explanations. Be comprehensive and thorough.
