  "inquiries_support": "Not found",
  "summary": "Derm Foundation is a TF-Keras image classification model focused on dermatology and digital dermatology for medical image feature extraction.",
  "keywords": "image classification, dermatology, digital dermatology, medical, medical embeddings, image feature extraction, TF-Keras, skin disease, diagnosis",
  "doi_dataset_used": "Not found",
  "intended_use_workflow": "Diagnosis and classification of skin conditions from images, likely as a support tool for dermatologists or other medical professionals.",
  "purpose": "To assist in the diagnosis of dermatological conditions by analyzing images.",
